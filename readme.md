this is a meta website cloning website application. 

details are given below : i have to make a website cloning project , this project would include passing input as ANY website and providing with a GitHub codebase of html css javascript for building this website.
Now , this project would be applicable only to short landing pages or simple website with 2-3 page depth.
Also, i am assuming any website which is passed through this can be recreated in html css and javascript and not anything else in tech stack.
